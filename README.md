  ## Description
  
  The goal of this project is to have a way to search what activities or amenities are available at a park near you.  For example, if you are looking for a park with a basketball court or would like to got oa park with trails, we want you to be able to find that using our app.

  When you first arrive on the main page, you are prompted to either login or if you do not have a login, you will be able to create login credentials.

  After successfully loggin in, you are met with a map displaying your favorite parks, a sidebar with different search parameters, and your results displayed in cards below.

  ![homepage]()

  This app is still a work in progress, but eventually we would like our users to be able to save their favorite parks and also create events at that park so other users can see different events happening at that park.
